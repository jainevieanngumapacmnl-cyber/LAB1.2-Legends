<h1>Welcome to legends</h1>

<br>

<p align  "justify"> Mobile Legends: Bang Bang (ML) is a popular 5v5 multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game played on mobile devices. Two teams compete on the same map, and each player controls one hero with unique skills and roles. The mati goal is to destroy the enemy base, but teams must first gain advantage by farming minions and jungle monsters for gold and experience. As players level up and buy items, they become stronger and can take bigger fights.</p>

<br>

<p align  "justify"> Winning in ML is not only about getting kills-it is mainly about teamwork and objectives. Players work together to push lanes, destroy turrets, secure important objectives like the Turtle and Lord, and control key areas of the map.
Good communication, proper timing, and understanding roles (Tank, Fighter, Assassin, Mage, Marksman, and Support) help a team win more consistently. By balancing farming, fighting, and objective-taking, teams can build momentum and finish the game.
